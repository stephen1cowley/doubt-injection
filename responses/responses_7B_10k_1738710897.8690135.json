["\nA farmer and a goat are on the left side of a river and must cross by boat.\nOn the right side of the river, there is a wolf and a cabbage.\nThe boat can carry only the farmer and a single item.\nIf left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.\nHow can the farmer get the goat to the right side of the river without anything being eaten?\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the farmer can get the goat, wolf, and cabbage across the river without any of them getting eaten. The boat can only carry the farmer and one item at a time. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation is:\n- Left side: Farmer, Goat\n- Right side: Wolf, Cabbage\n- Boat capacity: Farmer + 1 item\n\nConstraints:\n- Wolf and Goat can't be left alone together.\n- Goat and Cabbage can't be left alone together.\n\nSo, the farmer needs to transport all three items across without any pair being left together unattended.\n\nLet me outline the possible moves:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat across first.\n   - Left: Farmer (stays), Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right: Goat\n   But wait, if the farmer takes the goat over, he can't go back alone because the wolf and cabbage are on the right. Wait, no, the farmer can come back, but if he leaves the goat on the right, the wolf and cabbage are there, and wolf and cabbage can't be left alone. Hmm, no, that's fine because wolf and cabbage can be left alone. But wait, if the farmer takes the goat over, he can't go back because then the wolf and cabbage would be alone on the right, but the farmer could come back. Wait, no, the farmer can come back, but the right side would have wolf and cabbage, and the farmer is back on the left. So, that seems okay because wolf and cabbage can be left alone. Wait, but when the farmer is on the right, the goat is on the right, so if the farmer goes back, the goat is alone on the left, which is okay because wolf and cabbage are there. Hmm, maybe that's okay. Wait, no, if the farmer takes the goat over, he can go back, but then the goat would be alone on the right, which is not a problem because the farmer can come back and then take the goat again. Wait, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the farmer takes the goat over first:\n\n- Left: Farmer, Wolf, Cabbage\n- Right: Goat\n\nNow, the farmer can't leave the goat alone on the right with nothing else, but wait, the farmer is on the right, so the goat is alone. But the wolf and cabbage are on the left. If the farmer comes back, he can bring the goat back, but that seems inefficient. Maybe a better approach is to take the goat first.\n\nWait, no, maybe taking the goat first is the way to go. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the wolf first. Let's try that.\n\n2. Farmer takes the wolf across.\n   - Left: Farmer, Goat, Cabbage\n   - Right: Wolf\n   Now, if the farmer leaves the wolf on the right, he can't have the goat alone on the left, but the goat can eat the cabbage. So, if the farmer leaves the wolf, he can't have the goat on the left alone because the goat would eat the cabbage. So, that's a problem. So, taking the wolf first might not be a good idea because the farmer can't leave the goat on the left.\n\nSimilarly, if he takes the cabbage first:\n\n3. Farmer takes the cabbage across.\n   - Left: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n   - Right: Cabbage\n   Now, if the farmer leaves the cabbage on the right, the goat is on the left with the wolf, which is okay because the wolf can't eat the goat. Wait, no, the goat can eat the cabbage, so if the farmer leaves the cabbage on the right with the goat, that's a problem because the goat would eat the cabbage. So, the farmer can't leave the cabbage on the right alone with the goat. Therefore, he can't take the cabbage first because he can't leave the goat on the left with the wolf, but actually, the goat is on the left, and the wolf is on the right, so it's okay. Wait, no, the goat is on the left, but the farmer is on the right, so the goat is alone on the left, which is okay because the wolf is on the right. Wait, that seems possible.\n\nWait, no, if the farmer takes the cabbage first, then:\n\n- Left: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n- Right: Cabbage\n\nNow, the farmer is on the right with the cabbage, and the goat and wolf are on the left. The farmer can't be there forever, so he needs to go back, but if he goes back, he can bring the cabbage back, but then the wolf and goat are alone on the left, which is a problem because the wolf can eat the goat. So, that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, taking the cabbage first might not be a good idea either.\n\nSo, taking the goat first seems to be the only viable option.\n\nSo, back to taking the goat first:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat across.\n   - Left: Farmer, Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right: Goat\n\nNow, the farmer needs to get back. If he comes back alone, the goat is left on the right, but the wolf and cabbage are on the left. Wait, no, the wolf and cabbage are on the left, and the goat is on the right. The farmer can come back, but then he can take either the wolf or the cabbage next time.\n\nWait, if he takes the goat over, and then comes back, he can take either the wolf or the cabbage.\n\nLet's say he takes the goat over first, then comes back, taking the wolf next.\n\n2. Farmer goes back alone.\n   - Left: Farmer, Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right: Goat\n\n3. Farmer takes the wolf across.\n   - Left: Farmer, Cabbage\n   - Right: Wolf, Goat\n\nNow, the farmer is on the right with the wolf and goat, but the farmer can't leave the wolf and goat alone because the wolf would eat the goat. Wait, no, the wolf is on the right with the farmer, and the goat is also there. So, that's fine because the wolf and goat are both with the farmer. But the left side has only the farmer and the cabbage. Wait, no, the farmer is on the right, so the left side has only the cabbage, right?\n\nWait, no, let me correct that.\n\nAfter step 3:\n\n- Left: Farmer, Cabbage\n- Right: Wolf, Goat\n\nNow, the farmer is on the right with the wolf and goat, but he can't leave them alone because the wolf would eat the goat. So, he needs to come back alone to get the cabbage.\n\n4. Farmer goes back alone.\n   - Left: Farmer, Cabbage\n   - Right: Wolf, Goat\n\nNow, the farmer is back on the left with the cabbage. Now, he can take the cabbage over.\n\n5. Farmer takes the cabbage across.\n   - Left: Farmer\n   - Right: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nNow, the farmer is on the right with the wolf, goat, and cabbage. But wait, the farmer can leave the wolf and cabbage alone because the wolf and cabbage can be left alone. But the goat is there as well. Wait, but the wolf and goat can't be left alone because the wolf would eat the goat. So, this is a problem because the farmer can't have the wolf and goat alone on the right.\n\nWait, so after step 5, the farmer is on the right with the wolf, goat, and cabbage, but he can't leave the wolf and goat alone. So, that's a problem. Therefore, this approach is flawed.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after taking the goat over first, the farmer should take the wolf back. Let's see:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat across.\n   - Left: Farmer, Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right: Goat\n\n2. Farmer goes back alone.\n   - Left: Farmer, Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right: Goat\n\n3. Farmer takes the wolf across.\n   - Left: Farmer, Cabbage\n   - Right: Wolf, Goat\n\n4. Farmer brings the goat back.\n   - Left: Farmer, Goat, Cabbage\n   - Right: Wolf\n\n5. Farmer takes the cabbage across.\n   - Left: Farmer, Goat\n   - Right: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n6. Farmer takes the goat across again.\n   - Left: Farmer\n   - Right: Wolf, Cabbage, Goat\n\nWait, but in step 6, when the farmer takes the goat across, he leaves the wolf and cabbage on the right. The wolf and cabbage can be left alone, that's fine. So, that works.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat over. Left: F, W, C. Right: G. Okay, because F is there to protect G.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone. Left: F, W, C. Right: G. Okay, because F is there to protect W and C.\n\n3. Farmer takes the wolf over. Left: F, C. Right: W, G. Okay, because F is there to protect G and C.\n\n4. Farmer brings the goat back. Left: F, G, C. Right: W. Okay, because F is there to protect G and C.\n\n5. Farmer takes the cabbage over. Left: F, G. Right: W, C. Okay, because F is there to protect G and the wolf is on the right, but the wolf can't eat the cabbage, so that's fine.\n\n6. Farmer takes the goat over again. Left: F. Right: W, C, G. Okay, because F is there to protect everyone.\n\nSo, that works. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Take the goat across.\n\n2. Return alone.\n\n3. Take the wolf across.\n\n4. Bring the goat back.\n\n5. Take the cabbage across.\n\n6. Take the goat across again.\n\nWait, but in step 5, after taking the cabbage across, the left has F, G, and the right has W and C. Then, in step 6, the farmer takes the goat over, leaving everyone safely on the right.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n1. Farmer takes goat across.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone.\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf across.\n\n4. Farmer brings goat back.\n\n5. Farmer takes cabbage across.\n\n6. Farmer takes goat across.\n\nThat way, no item is left unattended with a predator.\n\nAlternatively, another way is:\n\n1. Take the wolf first, but that seems problematic because if you leave the goat alone on the right, the wolf can't eat the goat, but if you take the wolf first, you have to come back with it, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, let me try taking the wolf first.\n\n1. Farmer takes wolf across.\n\nLeft: F, G, C\n\nRight: W\n\n2. Farmer returns alone.\n\nLeft: F, G, C\n\nRight: W\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf back.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. If the farmer takes the wolf across, he can't leave it alone with the goat on the right because the wolf would eat the goat if the farmer isn't there. So, maybe taking the wolf first is not feasible because the farmer would have to come back with the wolf, which might complicate things.\n\nTherefore, taking the goat first seems to be the correct approach.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Farmer takes goat across.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone.\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf across.\n\n4. Farmer brings goat back.\n\n5. Farmer takes cabbage across.\n\n6. Farmer takes goat across again.\n\nYes, that seems to be the correct sequence.\n\nWait, but in step 5, after taking the cabbage across, the farmer is on the left with the goat, and the right has the wolf and cabbage. Then, in step 6, the farmer takes the goat across, leaving the wolf and cabbage alone on the right, which is fine because they can be left together.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat across.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone.\n\n3. Farmer takes the wolf across.\n\n4. Farmer brings the goat back.\n\n5. Farmer takes the cabbage across.\n\n6. Farmer takes the goat across again.\n\nSo, the sequence is: goat, then wolf, then goat back, then cabbage, then goat again.\n\nThat way, no item is left unattended with a predator.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe farmer can safely transport all items across the river by following these steps:\n\n1. **Take the goat across the river.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right: Goat\n\n2. **Return alone to the left side.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right: Goat\n\n3. **Take the wolf across the river.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Cabbage\n   - Right: Wolf, Goat\n\n4. **Bring the goat back to the left side.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Goat, Cabbage\n   - Right: Wolf\n\n5. **Take the cabbage across the river.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Goat\n   - Right: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n6. **Finally, take the goat across the river.**\n   - Left: Farmer\n   - Right: Wolf, Cabbage, Goat\n\nThis sequence ensures that no item is left unattended with a predator, thus solving the problem."]
