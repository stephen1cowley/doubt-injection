["\nA farmer and a goat are on the left side of a river and must cross by boat.\nOn the right side of the river, there is a wolf and a cabbage.\nThe boat can carry only the farmer and a single item.\nIf left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.\nHow can the farmer get the goat to the right side of the river without anything being eaten?\nAlright, so I've come across this classic river crossing puzzle, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down and think through it carefully.\n\nFirst, let me summarize the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. There's a farmer on the left side of a river, along with a goat. On the right side of the river, there's a wolf and a cabbage. The farmer needs to get all of them across the river using a boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and one other item at a time. The tricky part is that if the wolf and the goat are left alone together, the wolf will eat the goat. Similarly, if the goat and the cabbage are left alone, the goat will eat the cabbage. So, the farmer has to find a way to get everyone across without any of these unfortunate incidents happening.\n\nOkay, so let's list out what each character is:\n\n- Farmer: Can be on either side of the river.\n- Goat: Can be on either side, but needs protection if left with the wolf.\n- Wolf: Can be on either side, but needs protection if left with the goat.\n- Cabbage: Can be on either side, but needs protection if left with the goat.\n\nThe boat can only carry the farmer and one other item. So, each trip, the farmer can take either the goat, the wolf, or the cabbage, but not all three. The challenge is to figure out the sequence of trips that gets everyone safely across without any pair being left alone together.\n\nLet me try to visualize this as a series of steps. I think the key is to figure out which items can be left alone together and which ones can't. Then, plan the trips accordingly.\n\nFirst, the farmer is on the left with the goat. If he takes the goat across first, then he'll have to come back alone. But if he leaves the goat on the right, someone has to bring it back, and if he brings the wolf or the cabbage back, he has to make sure that the goat isn't left alone with either.\n\nWait, but if he takes the goat first, and then comes back alone, he can't leave the goat there. So, maybe he should take something else first? Hmm.\n\nLet me think. If he takes the goat across first, he leaves the goat on the right side with the wolf. That's bad because the wolf will eat the goat. So, he can't do that. Therefore, he must take either the wolf or the cabbage first.\n\nIf he takes the wolf first, he can leave it on the right side with the goat. But then, when he comes back to the left, he has to bring the wolf back, but the goat is still there. So, when he gets back, he can take the goat to the right, but then he has to leave the wolf alone on the right again. Wait, no, because he can only take one item each time.\n\nWait, maybe I should outline the possible moves.\n\nLet me denote the left side as L and the right side as R.\n\nInitially:\n\nL: Farmer, Goat\n\nR: Wolf, Cabbage\n\nWe need to get all to R without any pair being left alone together.\n\nSo, let's consider possible first moves.\n\nOption 1: Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\nResult:\n\nL: Farmer\n\nR: Goat, Wolf, Cabbage\n\nBut then, Farmer is on L alone, and Wolf and Goat are on R. Wolf and Goat can't be left alone, so that's bad. So, this move isn't allowed because it leads to an unsafe situation. So, the farmer can't take the goat first.\n\nOption 2: Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\nResult:\n\nL: Farmer, Goat\n\nR: Wolf\n\nBut then, Farmer is on L, and Goat is alone on R with nothing else. Wait, but the wolf is on R, and if the farmer leaves the wolf on R, then the goat is on L alone, but the wolf is on R. Is that a problem?\n\nWait, the problem states that if left unattended together, the wolf and goat or goat and cabbage can't be left alone. So, if the farmer takes the wolf to R, then on the left, there's only the farmer and goat. On the right, there's the wolf and cabbage. Wait, is that allowed?\n\nWait, no, because on the right, the wolf and cabbage are together, which is okay because they don't eat each other. On the left, the farmer and goat are together, which is okay because the farmer is there to protect the goat. So, perhaps that's a safe move.\n\nWait, but hold on. If the farmer takes the wolf to R, then he can't come back alone, because he would have to bring the wolf back. But if he brings the wolf back, then the wolf is on L, and the goat is on R. But Farmer is on L, so the goat is left alone on R with nothing else, but that's okay because the farmer isn't there to protect it.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem says that if left unattended together, the wolf and goat or goat and cabbage can't be left alone. So, if the farmer is on L with the goat, and the wolf is on R, is that okay?\n\nWait, when the farmer is on L, he's with the goat, so that's fine. On the right, the wolf and cabbage are together, which is okay. So, that seems safe.\n\nSo, step 1: Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\nNow, Farmer is on L, Goat is on L, Wolf is on R, Cabbage is on L.\n\nNow, Farmer needs to come back to L, but he can only take one item at a time.\n\nSo, step 2: Farmer comes back alone to L.\n\nNow, Farmer is on L with the goat, and the wolf is on R with the cabbage. That's okay because the wolf is on R with the cabbage, and the goat is on L with the farmer.\n\nBut wait, if the farmer is on L with the goat, and the wolf is on R with the cabbage, that seems safe. So, is that a valid state?\n\nWait, but actually, if the farmer is on L with the goat, and the wolf is on R with the cabbage, is that a problem? Because the wolf is on R with the cabbage, which is okay, and the goat is on L with the farmer, which is okay.\n\nSo, that seems safe. So, step 2: Farmer returns alone to L.\n\nNow, Farmer is on L with the goat.\n\nNow, what can he take next? He can take either the goat or the cabbage.\n\nIf he takes the goat, then he leaves the goat on L with the farmer, and the wolf and cabbage are on R. Wait, no, that's not the case.\n\nWait, actually, after step 2, Farmer is on L with the goat, and the wolf and cabbage are on R.\n\nSo, if Farmer takes the goat back to R, he would be leaving the goat on R with the wolf and cabbage, which is bad because the goat would eat the cabbage and the wolf would eat the goat.\n\nSo, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, Farmer can take the cabbage next.\n\nSo, step 3: Farmer takes the cabbage to R.\n\nNow, on R, we have the wolf, cabbage, and farmer.\n\nBut wait, Farmer is on R, so that's fine.\n\nOn L, we have the goat.\n\nBut now, Farmer is on R with the wolf, cabbage, and himself. So, when he leaves R, he needs to come back, but he can only take one item.\n\nWait, actually, he's on R with wolf, cabbage, and himself. If he takes the wolf back to L, then on R, he would leave the cabbage alone with the goat. Wait, because the wolf is on L, and the goat is on L, and the cabbage is on R.\n\nWait, no, after step 3, Farmer is on R with the wolf, cabbage, and himself, and the goat is on L.\n\nSo, step 4: Farmer comes back alone to L.\n\nNow, Farmer is on L with the goat, wolf, and cabbage? Wait, no, because Farmer can only take one item at a time.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to outline the steps clearly.\n\nAfter step 3: Farmer is on R with wolf and cabbage, and goat is on L.\n\nNow, if Farmer takes the wolf back to L, then:\n\nStep 4: Farmer takes the wolf to L.\n\nNow, on L: Farmer, wolf, goat\n\nOn R: cabbage\n\nBut then, Farmer is on L with wolf and goat, which is okay because the farmer is there to protect the goat.\n\nOn R, only cabbage is there, which is fine.\n\nNow, Farmer is on L, so he can take the goat or the cabbage next.\n\nIf he takes the goat, he leaves the wolf alone on L with nothing else. Wait, no, Farmer is taking the goat to R. So, step 5: Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\nNow, on R: Farmer, goat, cabbage\n\nOn L: wolf\n\nBut then, on R, the farmer is with the goat and cabbage, which is fine. On L, only the wolf is there, but the farmer is not there to protect it. So, is that a problem?\n\nWait, no, because the problem only mentions that the goat can't be left alone with the wolf or the cabbage alone with the goat. So, as long as the wolf isn't left alone with the goat or the goat isn't left alone with the cabbage, it's fine.\n\nBut in this case, on L, there's only the wolf. The farmer is on R, so the wolf is alone, but that's okay because the farmer isn't there to protect it.\n\nSo, that seems safe.\n\nSo, step 5: Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\nNow, all items are on R except the wolf, who is on R with the goat and cabbage. Wait, no, actually, after step 5, the farmer is on R with the goat, cabbage, and himself, and the wolf is on L.\n\nWait, no, let me recount.\n\nWait, step 4: Farmer takes the wolf back to L.\n\nSo, on L: Farmer, wolf, goat\n\nOn R: cabbage\n\nThen, step 5: Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\nNow, on R: Farmer, goat, cabbage\n\nOn L: wolf\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, on R, the farmer is with the goat and cabbage, which is fine. On L, there's only the wolf, but the farmer isn't there to protect it. So, is that a problem? Because the wolf is on L alone, but with no one to protect it, and the goat is on R with the farmer and cabbage. So, that seems okay.\n\nBut then, Farmer is on R, so he doesn't need to go back. So, is that the end? Wait, no, because the wolf is on L alone, which is not okay because no one is there to protect it. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so after step 5, we have:\n\nL: wolf\n\nR: Farmer, goat, cabbage\n\nBut the wolf is on L alone, which is a problem because if someone comes to get the wolf, it will be left alone on L, which is not okay. So, actually, we need to get the wolf to R as well.\n\nSo, after step 5, the farmer is on R with goat and cabbage, and the wolf is on L. So, to get the wolf to R, the farmer has to come back alone to L.\n\nStep 6: Farmer comes back alone to L.\n\nNow, on L: Farmer, wolf\n\nOn R: goat, cabbage\n\nNow, Farmer is on L with the wolf. If he takes the goat next, then:\n\nStep 7: Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\nBut then, on R, the goat is with the farmer and cabbage. On L, there's the wolf. Wait, no, Farmer is on R with the goat and cabbage, and the wolf is on L. So, Farmer is on R with goat and cabbage, and the wolf is on L alone. So, if Farmer leaves the goat on R with the cabbage, that's okay because they don't eat each other. On L, the wolf is alone, but Farmer is not there to protect it. So, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if Farmer takes the wolf to R, he can't because the goat is on L alone.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps again.\n\n1. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\nBut this leaves the goat on L alone, which is okay because the farmer is there. Wait, no, actually, when the farmer takes the wolf to R, he leaves the goat on L. So, on L: Farmer, Goat; on R: Wolf, Cabbage.\n\nIs that okay? Because the goat is on L with the farmer, and the wolf and cabbage are on R. Since the farmer is on L, the goat is safe. On R, the wolf and cabbage are together, which is okay because they don't eat each other. So, that seems safe.\n\nSo, step 1: Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the farmer takes the wolf to R, then comes back alone, the wolf is on R with the cabbage, and the farmer is on L with the goat. So, on L: Farmer, Goat; on R: Wolf, Cabbage.\n\nWait, that's similar to the initial state. So, this seems like going in circles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try taking the goat first, but that leads to a problem. So, perhaps the solution is to take the wolf first, then come back, then take the goat, bring the wolf back, take the cabbage, and bring the goat over.\n\nWait, that seems familiar. Let me try that.\n\n1. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\nThis is safe.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\nWait, no, if the farmer takes the wolf to R, and then returns alone, the wolf is on R with the cabbage, and the farmer is on L with the goat. So, on L: Farmer, Goat; on R: Wolf, Cabbage.\n\nThis is the same as the initial state but with the wolf and cabbage on R instead of nothing. So, it's not helpful. So, maybe taking the wolf first isn't the solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to take the cabbage first.\n\n1. Farmer takes the cabbage to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Cabbage, Wolf\n\nBut then, on R, the wolf is with the cabbage, which is okay. On L, the farmer and goat are together, which is okay.\n\nBut if the farmer comes back alone, then on L, there's only the goat, which is fine, but on R, the wolf is alone with the cabbage. That's bad because the wolf and cabbage can't be left alone.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution is:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Goat, Wolf, Cabbage\n\nBut this leaves the wolf and goat alone on R, which is bad.\n\nSo, that's not allowed.\n\nWait, so perhaps the solution is to take the wolf first, but then when bringing the wolf back, you have to leave the goat alone, which is allowed because the farmer is there.\n\nWait, let me try again.\n\n1. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\nWait, this is the same as before. So, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I need to take the goat over, but in a way that doesn't leave the goat alone.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n1. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut now, on L, the farmer and wolf are together. Is that okay? The problem didn't specify anything about the wolf and farmer, only about the goat. So, maybe that's okay.\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n5. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut then, on R, the wolf is with the goat and cabbage, which is okay. On L, the farmer is alone, which is okay because there's nothing to protect.\n\nWait, but hold on. If the farmer takes the wolf to R, then on R, the wolf is with the goat and cabbage. But the farmer is on L alone, so that's fine.\n\nSo, is that a solution?\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n3. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n5. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\nSo, final state:\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut is that acceptable? Because the farmer is on L alone, but all items are on R, and the wolf and goat and cabbage are together, which is fine because the wolf doesn't eat the goat, and the goat doesn't eat the cabbage.\n\nWait, but in step 3, after taking the goat to R, the farmer is on L alone with the wolf. So, that's okay because the farmer is there to protect the wolf. Then, he comes back alone, leaves the wolf on L, takes the wolf to R, and everyone is safe.\n\nSo, that seems like a solution.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check each step for safety.\n\n1. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat; R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n- Goat is with Farmer, Wolf and Cabbage are together but don't eat each other. Safe.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf; R: Cabbage\n\n- Farmer is with Goat and Wolf on L. Safe because Farmer is there.\n\n3. Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf; R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n- On L, Farmer and Wolf are together, which is okay. On R, Goat and Cabbage are together, which is okay. Safe.\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf; R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n- Farmer is alone on L with Wolf, which is okay because Farmer is there.\n\n5. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer; R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\n- On R, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage are together, which is okay. On L, Farmer is alone, which is okay because there's nothing to protect.\n\nSo, that seems to work.\n\nWait, but in step 3, when the farmer takes the goat to R, the wolf is left on L alone with the farmer. Is that a problem? Because if someone else comes to get the wolf, it would be left alone on L with the farmer? Wait, no, the farmer is on L with the wolf, so it's safe.\n\nWait, actually, when the farmer is on L with the wolf, that's fine because the farmer is there to protect the wolf. Then, when he comes back alone, the wolf is left on L alone, which is a problem because no one is there to protect it.\n\nWait, no, in step 4, the farmer returns alone to L, leaving the wolf on L alone. But that's a problem because the wolf is left alone on L with no one to protect it.\n\nWait, so that's a problem because when the farmer is on L alone, the wolf is left there, and the goat is on R with the farmer and cabbage. So, the wolf is on L alone, which is not allowed because it's not protected. So, that's a problem.\n\nSo, that approach doesn't work because step 4 leaves the wolf alone on L.\n\nSo, maybe I need to adjust the steps.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut this is a problem because on R, the goat is with the cabbage, which is okay, but on L, the farmer is with the wolf, which is okay. Wait, no, it's okay because the farmer is on R with the goat, and on L, there's the wolf. Wait, no, the farmer took the goat to R, so on L, there's the farmer and wolf.\n\nWait, that's okay because the farmer is there to protect the wolf.\n\nThen, the farmer can come back alone to L.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nNow, the farmer is on L with the wolf, which is okay.\n\n3. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nNow, on R, the wolf is with the goat and cabbage, which is okay. On L, the farmer is alone, which is okay because there's nothing to protect.\n\nSo, is that the solution?\n\nLet me check each step for safety.\n\n1. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n- On L, Farmer and Wolf are together, which is okay.\n\n- On R, Goat and Cabbage are together, which is okay.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n- On L, Farmer and Wolf are together, which is okay.\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\n- On R, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage are together, which is okay.\n\n- On L, Farmer is alone, which is okay because there's nothing to protect.\n\nSo, that works. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Take the goat to the right side.\n\n2. Return alone to the left side.\n\n3. Take the wolf to the right side.\n\nAnd everyone is safely on the right side.\n\nWait, but in this approach, when the farmer takes the goat first, that leaves the wolf alone on L. Is that a problem?\n\nWait, no, because the farmer is on R with the goat, and on L, the wolf is alone but that's okay because the farmer isn't there to protect it. Wait, but that's a problem because if the farmer leaves the goat on R, and then comes back alone, the wolf is left on L alone, which is not okay.\n\nWait, no, in the first step, the farmer takes the goat to R, so on R: Goat, and on L: Farmer and Wolf.\n\nSo, on L, the farmer is with the wolf, which is okay.\n\nThen, when the farmer comes back alone to L, the wolf is left on L alone, which is a problem because no one is there to protect it.\n\nWait, so that's the issue. So, that approach doesn't work because step 2 leaves the wolf alone on L.\n\nSo, maybe the solution is to take the wolf first, come back, take the goat, come back, take the wolf.\n\nWait, that might work.\n\nLet me try.\n\n1. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nSo, same as before. But in this case, when the farmer is on L alone, the wolf is left on L, which is a problem.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct approach is to take the wolf first, leave it on R, come back, take the goat, leave it on R, come back, take the wolf, and then everything is on R.\n\nBut in that case, when the farmer is on L with the goat, the wolf is left on R, which is fine because the wolf is on R with the cabbage, which is okay.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\n1. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\nWait, that's the same issue as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n1. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n5. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut in step 4, when the farmer is on L alone, the wolf is on R, and the goat and cabbage are on R with the wolf, which is fine because the wolf is there to protect the goat. Wait, no, the wolf is on R, so when the farmer is on L alone, the wolf is on R, which is fine because it's on R with the goat and cabbage. So, that's okay.\n\nWait, but in step 3, when the farmer takes the goat to R, he's leaving the wolf on L alone. Is that a problem?\n\nWait, no, because in step 3, the farmer is taking the goat to R, so on R, there's the goat and cabbage, and the wolf is on L with the farmer. So, on R, goat and cabbage are together, which is okay, and on L, the farmer and wolf are together, which is okay.\n\nThen, the farmer comes back alone to L in step 4.\n\nSo, on L: Farmer, Wolf\n\nOn R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nThen, in step 5, farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\nSo, final state:\n\nOn R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nOn L: Farmer\n\nWhich is safe.\n\nSo, that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, in step 3, when the farmer takes the goat to R, isn't the wolf left on L alone? Because on step 2, the farmer was on L with the goat, so he took the wolf to R, came back alone, left the wolf on L. So, on L, the wolf is alone, which is a problem because no one is there to protect it.\n\nWait, but in step 3, the farmer is on L alone, taking the goat to R, so on L, the wolf is alone, which is a problem.\n\nSo, that approach doesn't work because step 4 leaves the wolf alone on L.\n\nWait, so perhaps the only way is to have the wolf and goat never left alone together, and the wolf and cabbage never left alone together.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n1. Take the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut that leaves the wolf on L alone, which is a problem because the farmer isn't there to protect it.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, take the wolf first.\n\n1. Take the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n2. Return alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\n3. Take the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut now, on L, the farmer is alone with the wolf, which is okay because the farmer is there.\n\nThen, farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n4. Take the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nSo, that works.\n\nBut in step 2, when the farmer is on L with the goat and wolf, he can come back alone, leaving the wolf on L alone, which is a problem.\n\nWait, but when the farmer is on L in step 2, he has the goat and wolf with him, so the wolf isn't left alone.\n\nWait, no, step 2 is farmer returning alone to L, so after step 1, the farmer is on R with the wolf. Then, step 2, farmer returns alone to L, leaving the wolf on R. So, on L, there's the farmer and goat, which is okay.\n\nThen, step 3, farmer takes the goat to R. Wait, no, step 3 is farmer takes the goat to R.\n\nWait, let me clarify the steps:\n\n1. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n5. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nSo, in step 4, the farmer is on L alone, leaving the wolf on L. So, that's a problem because the wolf is alone on L with no one to protect it.\n\nSo, that approach doesn't work because step 4 leaves the wolf alone on L.\n\nTherefore, maybe the solution is:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut in step 2, the farmer is on L alone with the wolf, which is okay because the farmer is there.\n\nThen, in step 3, farmer takes the wolf to R, leaving the farmer alone on L.\n\nSo, that seems okay.\n\nWait, let me check each step.\n\n1. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\nBut wait, in step 3, after taking the wolf to R, the farmer is on L alone, which is okay because there's nothing to protect the wolf. But wait, on R, the wolf is with the goat and cabbage, which is okay.\n\nWait, but is that allowed? Because the farmer is on L alone, leaving the wolf on L alone, but the wolf is on R with the goat and cabbage.\n\nWait, no, because when the farmer takes the wolf to R, he leaves the wolf on R, so on L, the farmer is alone, which is okay because the wolf is on R with the goat and cabbage.\n\nWait, but in step 2, the farmer is on L with the wolf, which is okay. Then, he comes back alone, leaving the wolf on L alone, which is a problem.\n\nWait, so step 2 is problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution is:\n\n1. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n5. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut, as before, in step 4, the farmer is on L alone, leaving the wolf on L. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nThe classic solution to this puzzle is to take the goat first, then the wolf, then the goat again, then the cabbage.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes the wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut in step 2, the farmer is on L alone with the wolf, which is okay.\n\nThen, step 3, the farmer takes the wolf to R, leaving him on L alone.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to take the wolf first, then bring the goat back, then take the cabbage.\n\nWait, let me try:\n\n1. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n5. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut in step 4, the farmer is on L alone, leaving the wolf on L, which is a problem.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is:\n\n1. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf, Goat\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut in step 2, the farmer is on L alone with the wolf and goat, which is okay because the farmer is there.\n\nThen, step 3, the farmer takes the wolf to R, leaving him alone on L.\n\nSo, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the only solution is to take the wolf first, then the goat, then the wolf again, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try again.\n\n1. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat, Wolf\n\n- R: Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n5. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nBut as before, step 4 leaves the wolf alone on L.\n\nWait, so maybe the solution is:\n\n1. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n3. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n4. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n5. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\nBut that leaves the wolf alone on L in step 4, which is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is to take the goat first, then the wolf, but that seems to cause the wolf to be alone.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is:\n\n1. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n4. Farmer brings goat back to L.\n\n5. Farmer takes cabbage to R.\n\nSo, let's go through that.\n\n1. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\n4. Farmer brings goat back to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n5. Farmer takes cabbage to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nSo, now, all items are on R, and the farmer is there.\n\nBut let's check each step for safety.\n\n1. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Wolf\n\n- R: Goat, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n4. Farmer brings goat back to L.\n\n- L: Farmer, Goat\n\n- R: Wolf, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\n5. Farmer takes cabbage to R.\n\n- L: Farmer\n\n- R: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n\nSafe.\n\nSo, in this case, step 4, the farmer is bringing the goat back to L, so on L, there's the farmer and the goat, which is okay because the farmer is there to protect the goat.\n\nThen, the farmer takes the cabbage to R, leaving the wolf on R with the goat and cabbage, which is okay because the wolf is on R with the others.\n\nWait, no, when the farmer takes the cabbage to R, he's leaving the wolf on R with the goat and cabbage, which is okay because the wolf is there to protect the goat.\n\nWait, but actually, the wolf is on R with the goat and cabbage, which is okay because the wolf doesn't eat the cabbage.\n\nWait, but in this case, the wolf is on R with the goat and cabbage, so that's fine.\n\nBut in this scenario, step 4 is the farmer bringing the goat back to L, leaving the wolf on R with the cabbage, which is okay.\n\nSo, that seems like a valid solution.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Farmer takes the goat to the right side.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to the left side.\n\n3. Farmer takes the Wolf to the right side.\n\n4. Farmer brings the Goat back to the left side.\n\n5. Farmer takes the Cabbage to the right side.\n\nSo, all items are safely on the right side, and at no point were the goat and wolf or the wolf and cabbage left alone together.\n\nTherefore, that's the solution.\n\nBut wait, in step 4, the farmer is bringing the goat back to L, leaving the wolf on R with the cabbage.\n\nBut that's okay because the wolf is on R with the goat and cabbage, which is fine.\n\nWait, but the wolf and cabbage can be left together, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is:\n\n1. Farmer takes goat to R.\n\n2. Farmer returns alone to L.\n\n3. Farmer takes wolf to R.\n\n4. Farmer brings goat back to L.\n\n5. Farmer takes cabbage to R.\n\nThus, everyone is safely on the right side without any conflicts.\n\nWait, but in step 2, the farmer is on L alone with the wolf, which is okay because he's there.\n\nThen, in step 3, he takes the wolf to R, leaving the farmer alone on L.\n\nThen, in step 4, he brings the goat back to L, so on L, the farmer and goat are together, which is okay because the farmer is there.\n\nThen, in step 5, he takes the cabbage to R, leaving the wolf on R with the goat and cabbage, which is okay.\n\nSo, that's the correct solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the farmer takes the goat first, then returns alone, takes the wolf, brings the goat back, and finally takes the cabbage.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n1. Take the goat to the right side.\n\n2. Return alone to the left side.\n\n3. Take the wolf to the right side.\n\n4. Bring the goat back to the left side.\n\n5. Take the cabbage to the right side.\n\nThus, all items are safely on the right side without any conflicts.\n</think>\n\nThe farmer can safely get all the animals and the cabbage across the river by following these steps:\n\n1. Take the goat to the right side.\n2. Return alone to the left side.\n3. Take the wolf to the right side.\n4. Bring the goat back to the left side.\n5. Take the cabbage to the right side.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Take the goat to the right side.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Wolf\n   - Right: Goat, Cabbage\n   - The wolf and goat are together alone, which is safe.\n\n2. **Return alone to the left side.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Wolf, Goat\n   - Right: Cabbage\n   -The farmer is present to protect the wolf and goat.\n\n3. **Take the wolf to the right side.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Goat\n   - Right: Wolf, Cabbage\n   -The wolf is now alone with the cabbage, which is safe because the wolf doesn't eat the cabbage.\n\n4. **Bring the goat back to the left side.**\n   - Left: Farmer, Goat\n   - Right: Wolf, Cabbage\n   -The farmer ensures the goat is safe on the left side.\n\n5. **Take the cabbage to the right side.**\n   - Left: Farmer\n   - Right: Wolf, Goat, Cabbage\n   -All items are safely on the right side with the farmer present.\n\nBy following these steps, the farmer ensures that no animal is left alone with a predator, thus solving the puzzle successfully."]
