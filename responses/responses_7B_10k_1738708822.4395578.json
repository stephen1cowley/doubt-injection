["\nA farmer and a goat are on the left side of a river and must cross by boat.\nOn the right side of the river, there is a wolf and a cabbage.\nThe boat can carry only the farmer and a single item.\nIf left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.\nHow can the farmer get the goat to the right side of the river without anything being eaten?\n\\\n\n<think>\nFirst, I need to identify the constraints and the goal of the problem. The farmer, goat, wolf, and cabbage are all on the left side of the river, and the wolf and cabbage are on the right side. The boat can only carry the farmer and one item at a time. If left alone, the wolf would eat the goat, and the goat would eat the cabbage. The objective is to get all items to the right side without any of these incidents happening.\n\nTo solve this, I'll outline a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Take the Goat First:**\n   - The farmer takes the goat across the river.\n   - On the left side, only the wolf and cabbage remain, which is safe.\n\n2. **Return Alone:**\n   - The farmer goes back to the left side without the goat.\n\n3. **Take the Wolf Next:**\n   - The farmer takes the wolf across the river.\n   - On the left side, there's only the goat, which is safe from the wolf.\n\n4. **Take the Goat Back:**\n   - The farmer brings the goat back to the left side.\n\n5. **Take the Cabbage Finally:**\n   - The farmer takes the cabbage across the river.\n   - On the left side, only the goat is present, ensuring its safety from the cabbage.\n\nBy following this sequence, all items are safely transported to the right side without any of the animals or plants being eaten.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of getting the goat, wolf, and cabbage across the river without any of them being eaten, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Take the Goat Across the River:**\n   - The farmer takes the goat and leaves it on the right side.\n   - **Left Side:** Wolf, Cabbage\n   - **Right Side:** Goat\n\n2. **Return Alone to the Left Side:**\n   - The farmer goes back to the left side without the goat.\n   - **Left Side:** Wolf, Cabbage, Farmer\n   - **Right Side:** Empty\n\n3. **Take the Wolf Across the River:**\n   - The farmer takes the wolf to the right side.\n   - **Left Side:** Cabbage\n   - **Right Side:** Wolf, Farmer\n\n4. **Return the Goat to the Left Side:**\n   - The farmer brings the goat back to the left side.\n   - **Left Side:** Cabbage, Goat, Farmer\n   - **Right Side:** Wolf\n\n5. **Take the Cabbage Across the River:**\n   - Finally, the farmer takes the cabbage to the right side.\n   - **Left Side:** Goat\n   - **Right Side:** Wolf, Cabbage, Farmer\n\nBy following these steps, the farmer ensures that the wolf doesn't eat the goat and the goat doesn't eat the cabbage while they are left alone. \n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n1. &\\text{ Farmer takes the goat across the river.} \\\\\n2. &\\text{ Farmer returns alone to the left side.} \\\\\n3. &\\text{ Farmer takes the wolf across the river.} \\\\\n4. &\\text{ Farmer returns the goat to the left side.} \\\\\n5. &\\text{ Farmer takes the cabbage across the river.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}"]
